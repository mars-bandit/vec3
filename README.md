# @arrgh/vec3

_TypeScript 3D Vector_ library based on iterators and arrays, **UNCOMPILED**, _use `"moduleResolution": "node"`_.

Inspired by glMatrix and glm.

Like glMatrix we will flatten iteration, but unlike glMatrix, we will not inline function calls, we will let that task to the minifier and / or JIT.
